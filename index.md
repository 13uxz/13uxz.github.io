  text:
    - 13uxz takes satisfaction in tailoring unique and dynamic sets that captivate audiences. With a collection of over 13,000 tracks across various genres, he delivers seamless mixes with a keen ear for thoughtful track selection. His passion for music is complemented by professional training, including courses at Granular DXB, Toolroom, and Point Blank Music School, as well as private tuition with locally and internationally recognized artists. He has also taught at Original Mix DJs and Dubai Sound Academy, with his students performing at events in Dubai and internationally.

    -  After completing a successful two-year residency at Masti, 13uxz has now moved on to a residency at Jamavar and Mimi Meifair, following the relocation of these Michelin-star restaurants from London to Dubai. He regularly performs at corporate gigs, with notable events including a COP28 staff closing party and the Tilal Al Ghaf Real Estate Awards. His preferred genres—Afrohouse and Melodic Techno/House —are not only reflected in his DJ sets but evident in his releases on Soviett Records and Mystic Carousel Records, with more lined up for 2024.
    
    - 13uxz also has a range of experience performing alongside percussionists and saxophonists, integrating their live elements seamlessly into his sets. Early experiences in Dubai include gigs at venues such as S Bar at SLS and Candypants at the Akira Back (W Hotel) on the Palm Jumeirah. Further notable experiences include entertaining 25,000 people during the Dubai Shopping Festival on New Year’s Eve, performing at the techno event Modulate at KYO on the Palm and a New Years Eve performance at Offside, JBR. 

    - His mixes have been aired on BeatFM as part of a weekly show, featuring both his work and that of his students. With a passion for music and an eye on the future, 13uxz is looking for further opportunities that may arise.
